## Keyboard by Sosa

The goal of my application is to display a working keyboard inspired by an old fashion casio keyboard. I wanted
it to be able to play various notes along with adjust the volume, display the keys, and show it on and off.
When working on the application problems arose such as the CSP and connecting the javascript file to html without
it throwing restriction errors. Creating a way to hide the key labels took a little while to conceptialize as well.
I wanted the keyboard to give off an old fashion look so I decided to use cursive so if it is difficult to read,
the labels say, in order from left to right, "keyboard", "volume", "show keys", and "power".
